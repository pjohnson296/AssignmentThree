CS 188 - Assignment three - Paxten Johnson, Joe Snee, Alex Peterson

After much duress, Paxten finally got a working repo for all of us to contribute to.

Alex Added the second page to the app, which included a ratings bar and some text.  Joe added another button to pull up the "cute" screen.  Paxten played around with formatting (colors, font sizes, button appearance, and spacing), fixed parental heirarchy on second/third screens, and added a scrolling feature in the 'journaling' area on screen one.
